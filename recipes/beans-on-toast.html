        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a rendition of the classic British recipe beans on toast. This recipe was originally created by Joshua Wiessman and can be found on <a href="https://youtu.be/ydbMAFaA6Uw">youtube</a>.</p>

        <p>My favorite thing about this recipe is how easy it is to put it together. All ingredients are thrown into one pot, and there is no need to chop anything up! It's simply a matter of combining the ingredients in the proper order. I like to serve this on a toasted baguette, but it can really be served with any type of bread. The original recipe also called for navy beans, but we found that great northern beans work great as well. One important thing that you CAN NOT skimp out on is the chorizo. The chorizo gives it all the flavor and texture. Wegman's seems to have the best chorizo thus far. Walmart was okay, but not great. I'd be interested in trying Weis market Chorizo as well.</p>
