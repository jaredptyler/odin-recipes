        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a fantastic Thai peanut noodle with chicken recipe, all made in the instant pot. The original thai noodle recipe comes from <a href="https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/instant-pot-thai-chicken-noodles/#tasty-recipes-12092-jump-target">365daysofcrockpot.com</a>.</p>

        <p>I love this recipe because it is quick and easy, but tastes great! Everything is cooked right in the instant pot which makes for easy clean up. Not to mention the instant pot is great for nights when people are coming and going because once it is finished cooking, you can set it on warm to keep it warm for 2 hours!</p>
