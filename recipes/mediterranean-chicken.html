        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious and healthy mediterranean diet meal. The original recipe can be found on <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/one-skillet-mediterranean-chicken-recipe/">themediterraneandish.com</a>.</p>

        <p>I chose to add this meal because it is so healthy and refreshing, but at the same time, extremely simple and can be made in a single pan. Try chicken breasts for a healthier lean cut or chicken thighs for a more flavorful fattier cut. Diced tomatoes can be fresh or canned, but I prefer fresh.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts of equal size</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry wine (optional)</li>
            <li>1 large lemon, juice of</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped red onion</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup small-diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Crumbled feta, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken breasts dry. On each side of the chicken breasts make three slits through.</li>
            <li>Spread 2 tbsp garlic on both sides; insert some garlic into the slits. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt, pepper and ½ tbsp of dried oregano.</li>
            <li>In a large cast iron skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium-high. Brown the chicken on both sides.</li>
            <li>Add the white wine and let reduce by ½ then add the lemon juice and ½ cup of chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining oregano on top. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover with a lid or tightly with foil. Cook for 10-15 mins turning the chicken over once (chicken's internal temperature should reach 165 degrees F.)</li>
            <li>Uncover and top with the chopped onions and tomatoes. Cover again and cook for only 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally add the parsley and feta cheese. Can be served with a light pasta, rice, or couscous.</li>
        </ol>
