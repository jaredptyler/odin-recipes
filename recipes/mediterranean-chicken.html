        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious and healthy mediterranean diet meal. The original recipe can be found on <a href="https://www.themediterraneandish.com/one-skillet-mediterranean-chicken-recipe/">themediterraneandish.com</a>.</p>

        <p>I chose to add this meal because it is so healthy and refreshing, but at the same time, extremely simple and can be made in a single pan. Try chicken breasts for a healthier lean cut or chicken thighs for a more flavorful fattier cut. Diced tomatoes can be fresh or canned, but I prefer fresh.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp oil</li>
            <li>1.5lb chicken breast or thigh</li>
            <li>3 clove minced garlic</li>
            <li>2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>8 oz whole wheat spaghetti noodles</li>
            <li>Lime juice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped Peanuts for topping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Turn on pressure cooker to saute mode and let heat up</li>
            <li>While heating up, cut up the chicken into cubes.  Also cut up the bell pepper into small chunks</li>
            <li>Once hot, put oil in pressure cooker. Then put in chopped chicken. And saute for ~3 minutes</li>
            <li>Add in garlic and saute for 30 seconds</li>
